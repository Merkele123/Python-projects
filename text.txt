The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A watched pot never boils, they say.
The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
The early bird catches the worm every day.
Life is what happens when youâ€™re busy making other plans.
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.
Actions speak louder than words in every situation.
